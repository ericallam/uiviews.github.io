# Test Post

This is a test post for UIViews. Going to write a few more words so this first section looks and feels like a paragraph. I would assume the average paragraph size is about 4 sentences. After this sentence we should be right about there.

List test
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

This line has some `IBAction`. Need to add some syntax highlighting.

Here is a code block

### Code Block

```
CGRect viewRect = CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 100);
UIView* myView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:viewRect];
```

And we'll close some some simple **bold** and *italics*.
